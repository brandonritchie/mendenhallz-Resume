I think you have a really solid resume and I hope to be where you're at when I am finishing up school. A couple of short things that you can either leave or take:

1. I would put your current job at the top of your resume under your name and above your info. 
2. I would put your years attended at BYU-I and expected graduation/graduation date since you are nearly graduated.
3. If possible I would try and consolidate the bullets under "Marketing and SEO Specialist" to 3-4 powerful bullets.
4. I would try and summarize mission experience into one bullet point.

Good luck man!
